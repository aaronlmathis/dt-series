# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the production-ready CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated Terraform and Ansible deployments with multi-environment support.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The CI/CD pipeline implements:

- **Multi-Environment Strategy**: Separate dev, staging, and production environments
- **GitOps Workflows**: Pull request-based infrastructure changes
- **Security & Compliance**: Automated security scanning and approval processes
- **Disaster Recovery**: Automated rollback and recovery capabilities
- **Azure OIDC Integration**: Secure authentication without storing credentials

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Azure CLI installed locally
- Terraform and Ansible installed locally

### 2. Initial Setup

1. **Setup Azure Backend Storage** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   # Login to Azure
   az login
   
   # Run setup script
   make setup-backend
   ```

2. **Create Service Principal for GitHub Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Create service principal with OIDC
   az ad app create --display-name "dt-series-github-actions"
   
   # Get the application ID
   APP_ID=$(az ad app list --display-name "dt-series-github-actions" --query '[0].appId' -o tsv)
   
   # Create service principal
   az ad sp create --id $APP_ID
   
   # Get the object ID
   OBJECT_ID=$(az ad sp list --display-name "dt-series-github-actions" --query '[0].objectId' -o tsv)
   
   # Assign contributor role
   az role assignment create --role contributor --assignee-object-id $OBJECT_ID --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal --scope /subscriptions/$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
   
   # Configure federated credentials for GitHub Actions
   az ad app federated-credential create --id $APP_ID --parameters '{
     "name": "GitHubActions",
     "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
     "subject": "repo:aaronlmathis/dt-series:ref:refs/heads/main",
     "description": "GitHub Actions OIDC",
     "audiences": ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]
   }'
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   Go to your repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions, and add:
   
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The application (client) ID
   - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Your Azure tenant ID
   - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Your Azure subscription ID
   - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your SSH private key for VM access

   ```bash
   # Get the required values
   echo "AZURE_CLIENT_ID: $APP_ID"
   echo "AZURE_TENANT_ID: $(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)"
   echo "AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: $(az account show --query id -o tsv)"
   ```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Each environment has its own configuration in the `environments/` directory:

- `environments/dev/` - Development environment
- `environments/staging/` - Staging environment  
- `environments/production/` - Production environment

## üîÑ CI/CD Workflows

### Pull Request Validation

**Trigger**: Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

**Process**:
1. Security scanning (Trivy, Checkov)
2. Terraform validation for all environments
3. Ansible syntax checking and linting
4. Integration tests
5. PR comment with results

### Development Deployment

**Trigger**: Push to `develop` branch

**Process**:
1. Terraform plan and apply for dev environment
2. Ansible configuration deployment
3. Post-deployment testing
4. Automatic deployment on success

### Staging Deployment

**Trigger**: Successful development deployment

**Process**:
1. Terraform plan and apply for staging environment
2. Ansible configuration deployment
3. Comprehensive testing (deployment, security, performance)
4. Manual approval gate for production

### Production Deployment

**Trigger**: Manual approval after successful staging deployment

**Process**:
1. Manual approval checkpoint
2. Production data backup
3. Terraform plan and apply for production environment
4. Ansible configuration deployment
5. Production smoke tests
6. Deployment notifications

### Disaster Recovery & Rollback

**Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch

**Features**:
- Rollback to previous successful deployment
- Infrastructure and/or configuration rollback
- Automated backup before rollback
- Validation and testing after rollback

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

### Using the Enhanced Makefile

```bash
# Deploy to different environments
make dev          # Deploy to development
make staging      # Deploy to staging  
make production   # Deploy to production

# Environment-specific commands
make plan ENV=staging           # Plan for staging
make ssh ENV=production        # SSH to production VM
make test ENV=dev             # Test development deployment

# Validation and testing
make validate-all             # Run all validations
make security-scan           # Run security scans
make test-infrastructure     # Test infrastructure config
```

### Using Deployment Scripts

```bash
# Full deployment with script
./scripts/deploy-environment.sh dev apply
./scripts/deploy-environment.sh staging plan
./scripts/deploy-environment.sh production destroy
```
