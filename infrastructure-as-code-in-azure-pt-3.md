Continuing our Infrastructure as Code in Azure series, this article elevates our Terraform and Ansible automation to enterprise-grade CI/CD pipelines. In Parts 1 and 2, we built the foundation with infrastructure provisioning and security hardening. Now, we'll implement production-ready deployment workflows, multi-environment strategies, and comprehensive testing frameworks that scale across development teams.

Modern DevOps requires more than just infrastructure automation—it demands reliable, auditable, and scalable deployment pipelines. This tutorial demonstrates how to transform our existing Terraform and Ansible codebase into a comprehensive CI/CD system using GitHub Actions, complete with security scanning, approval workflows, and disaster recovery capabilities.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- **Build production-ready CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions for automated deployments
- **Implement secure Azure authentication** with OpenID Connect (OIDC) for passwordless workflows
- **Create multi-environment strategies** with isolated development, staging, and production deployments
- **Establish approval workflows** with Terraform plan reviews and environment promotion gates
- **Integrate security scanning** with automated vulnerability detection and compliance checking
- **Design disaster recovery workflows** for business continuity and incident response
- **Implement comprehensive testing** frameworks for infrastructure validation and deployment verification

This practical guide demonstrates how to scale infrastructure automation from individual deployments to enterprise-grade DevOps practices. By the end, you'll have a complete CI/CD system capable of managing complex, multi-environment infrastructure with the reliability and security standards required for production workloads.

## Prerequisites and Current State

This tutorial builds upon [Part 1: Infrastructure as Code in Azure – Introduction to Terraform](/blog/infrastructure-as-code-in-azure-pt-1) and [Part 2: Infrastructure as Code in Azure – Security Hardening and Configuration With Ansible](/blog/infrastructure-as-code-in-azure-pt-2). 

To proceed, ensure you have:
- Completed Parts 1 and 2 with working Terraform and Ansible automation
- A GitHub repository containing your infrastructure code
- Azure CLI configured with appropriate subscription access
- Basic understanding of GitHub Actions and YAML syntax

The CI/CD pipelines in this guide assume your project structure matches the previous tutorials, with separated `provisioning/` and `configuration-management/` directories containing your Terraform and Ansible configurations respectively.

## Enterprise Project Structure

Before implementing CI/CD pipelines, we need to restructure our project to support enterprise-grade multi-environment deployments. This organization follows DevOps best practices by separating environments, implementing proper testing frameworks, and providing comprehensive automation scripts.

## Setting Up Azure Backend for State Management

Enterprise CI/CD requires centralized Terraform state management with proper locking and encryption. We'll configure Azure Storage for remote state storage across all environments.

### Azure Backend Configuration Script

**FILE SOURCE: scripts/setup-azure-backend.sh**

Create the Azure backend setup script that automatically provisions storage accounts for each environment:

[Insert complete setup-azure-backend.sh script here]

This script creates separate storage accounts for each environment, ensuring complete isolation of Terraform state files and preventing cross-environment contamination.

### Environment-Specific Backend Configuration

**FILE SOURCE: environments/dev/backend.tf**
**FILE SOURCE: environments/staging/backend.tf** 
**FILE SOURCE: environments/production/backend.tf**

Each environment requires its own backend configuration:

[Insert backend.tf configurations for each environment]

---

## Multi-Environment Configuration Strategy

Enterprise deployments require environment-specific configurations that balance consistency with flexibility. Our approach uses parameterized configurations that adapt to different environments while maintaining infrastructure as code principles.

### Development Environment Configuration

**FILE SOURCE: environments/dev/terraform.tfvars**

Development environments prioritize cost optimization and developer productivity:

[Insert dev terraform.tfvars]

**FILE SOURCE: environments/dev/ansible_vars.yml**

Development-specific Ansible variables enable relaxed security for easier testing:

[Insert dev ansible_vars.yml]

### Staging Environment Configuration

**FILE SOURCE: environments/staging/terraform.tfvars**

Staging environments mirror production configurations for accurate testing:

[Insert staging terraform.tfvars]

**FILE SOURCE: environments/staging/ansible_vars.yml**

Staging Ansible variables balance security with testing requirements:

[Insert staging ansible_vars.yml]

### Production Environment Configuration

**FILE SOURCE: environments/production/terraform.tfvars**

Production environments enforce strict security and performance standards:

[Insert production terraform.tfvars]

**FILE SOURCE: environments/production/ansible_vars.yml**

Production Ansible variables implement maximum security hardening:

[Insert production ansible_vars.yml]

## Azure Authentication with OpenID Connect

Modern DevOps security requires passwordless authentication using OpenID Connect (OIDC). This eliminates the need to store long-lived secrets while providing secure, auditable access to Azure resources.

### Service Principal Configuration

The Azure backend setup script creates the necessary service principal with OIDC federation:

```bash
# Create service principal for GitHub Actions
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "dt-series-github-actions" \
  --role "Contributor" \
  --scopes "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"

# Configure OIDC federation
az ad app federated-credential create \
  --id $CLIENT_ID \
  --parameters '{
    "name": "github-actions-main",
    "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
    "subject": "repo:username/dt-series:ref:refs/heads/main",
    "audiences": ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]
  }'
```

### GitHub Secrets Configuration

Required secrets for OIDC authentication:
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Service principal application ID
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Azure Active Directory tenant ID
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Target Azure subscription ID
